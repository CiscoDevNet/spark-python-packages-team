# Charter
**Spark Python Packages Team**


_It helps to start on common ground..._
 
## Purpose
As several efforts have been made by individuals to produce a Python API wrapper and/or SDK for the Cisco Spark services (links to the individual efforts are included below), we the Spark Python community thought it well to put a collaborative effort together to conserve engery, build upon the good work that had already been done, and to enable others to get involved to enhance and iteratively advance the common interest at hand - the Spark Python Packages.

## Outcomes
**Spark Python Packages to be published to the Python Package Index**
The goal initially is to produce two packages for use and enhancement by the Cisco Spark Python development community:

  1. **ciscosparkapi** - A simple, scalable and lightweight API wrapper
  2. **ciscosparksdk** - Additional features and functionality useful to Cisco Spark API developers

## Who can contribute?
Everyone!  This is a community effort.  Members of the @CiscoDevNet/spark-python-packages-team will have Write access to the project repositories and everyone else will have Read access with the ability to read, clone, submit pull requests, and to create and comment on issues in the ongoing discussions around the project.

Want to contribute to this effort in a greater measure and help be responsible for maintaining the contributions and packages?  Please reach out to the project team on Spark (link to Spark Room coming soon).

## Project Principles
To bring some consistency to this community development effort, the following principles have been proposed and are currently the baseline or standards for this community development effort.

| Principle                 | Reference |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| **Style Guide**           | [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names) |
| **Docstring Conventions** | [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) |
| **Documentation Format**  | [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) |
| **Commit Messages**       | Imperative mood ([How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)) |
| **Release Versioning**    | [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) |

**Note:**  As this is a community development effort, these principles are open for discussion and revision.  If you would like to suggest a revision, removal or addition to these principles, please create a [New issue](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/spark-python-packages-team/issues).
